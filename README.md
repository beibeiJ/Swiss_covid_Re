# Swiss_covid_Re

R script for estimating the reproduction number of the Swiss COVID-19 epidemic. 
Allows one to estimate Re through time, using EpiEstim and produce a plot such as the one on this webpage: https://bsse.ethz.ch/cevo/research/sars-cov-2.html

The confirmed case data is from https://github.com/openZH/covid_19 maintained by the Specialist Unit for Open Government Data Canton of Zurich.
We pull the data via Daniel Probst handy restructuring of the data https://github.com/daenuprobst/covid19-cases-switzerland/.
